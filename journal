11/09/24 Working on game-board layout game-board_wrapper shouldn't overflow
create a disable class for buttons Don't know how below is working, but it seems
to be:
<button class="btn" id="hit-btn" onClick="hitUser('userHandOne')">
  <!--This looks wrong, hitUser should have ambiguous params  -->
  Hit
</button>

--> Need to make dealing more realistic feeling. --> Outcome UI is weak I want
celebratory effects for a win. Needs to be obviousl what happened. --> the flow
of double is bad. Everything happens at once. Timing stuff might be difficult
because I didn't consider that when implementing current structure. END summary
- left off inside dealCard() trying to figure out how to get the currently being
dealt card element in the right scope so i can transition position using CSS
class change
